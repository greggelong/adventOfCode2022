## a place to hold some code for Advent of code 2022

https://adventofcode.com/2022

I am starting a couple days late.

I have caught up by December 4th
let's see if I can keep it up.

really hacky solutions in python


- [X] day one -- used a dictionary to keep track of elves and calories list. , could have just used a list of list.
- [X] day two -- rock paper scissors -- some long winded logic
- [X] day three -- found used a lookup table (list and index) to keep track of priorities values and " in to check for duplicates in second list
- [X] day four -- tried using strings but ran into edge case problems, then sets, finally used lists and all() and any() to find lists that contain each other or overlap

- [X] day five -- made something like a simple interpreter to execute movement commands on  2d stacks of boxes, nested lists as stacks
- [X] day six -- this time I used set() to check for no repeats in a list - of 4 or 14 characters
